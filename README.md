In the case of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a baby less than 1 year old experiences a sudden and unexpected death during sleep. There are no indications of illness, no prior symptoms, and it occurs in otherwise healthy infants. Unfortunately, the direct cause of SIDS is unknown.

This embedded challenge aims to build an embedded system that can determine if a person has stopped breathing for more than 10 seconds, after which, a trigger is activated as a notification or an “alert” that something is wrong.

The project uses an STM32F429 microcontroller and an SGP30 air quality sensor.
